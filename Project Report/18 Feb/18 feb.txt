So today i learned about 
- AJAX and AJAJ,
- What is Api's and Json (most of it i already knew)
- tools like postman and hopp scotch
- URLs and Http HEADERS and VERBS (get, post,delete, etc)
- what is status code
    {
        2XX => Everything Good
        3XX => Redirecting to somewhere
        4XX => User has done something wrong
        5XX => There is a problem in Server 
    }
- Way to interact with the APIs
    - XHR => old and irrelevant method
    - Fetch => fetch function in js return a promises 
    - Axios => A third party library has to be imported and it uses             
               Axios.get(1,2)function uses fecth in backend but it return a    
               json object

- That's it :| somewhat happy like 6/10
